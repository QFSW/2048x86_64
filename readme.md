`2048x86_64` is the game _2048_ written purely in `x64` assembly

### Playing

Download [here](https://github.com/QFSW/2048x86_64/releases)

Control with `wasd` for grid movement

### Building
Open `2048x86_64.sln` in Visual Studio and build the project

The entirity of the game is found underneath `src` if you would like to assemble it without Visual Studio

### Notes
Assembled and tested with `Visual Studio 2019` (`MASM`) under `Windows 10` with a `i7-4790k` CPU

Likely works on all `x64` CPUs (and possibly other operating systems) but not tested
